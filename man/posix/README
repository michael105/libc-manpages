These are pages from POSIX.1-2008, Technical Corrigendum 1.
Since TC1 appeared in 2013, it is also known as POSIX.1-2013.

This package contains the POSIX man pages (pages in sections
except 0p, 1p, and 3p). Some more information is given in the
`Announce' file.  Some background on UNIX standards, including
POSIX, can be found in the standards(7) page provide as part
of the separate Linux man-pages package.

Install by copying to your favourite location.
"make install" will just copy them to /usr/share/man/man[013]p.
"make" will move the pages from this package that are older than
the already installed ones to a subdirectory `not_installed',
then remove old versions (compressed or not),
compress the pages, and copy them to /usr/share/man/man[013]p.

Note that you may have to remove preformatted pages.
